                    Hi! Shubro here. I first started to learn programming for
                    finding out of curiosity. I started to develop a passion for helping small
                    businesses grow and I wanted to do this by amplifying their online
                    presence. The best way for me to do this, or at least to start, is by
                    building websites for small businesses in my area to really help them
                    grow.
